(* Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot say: The assert & pose proof tactics do the
   same thing actually. The cost seems related to a retyping of the
   term. *)

Axiom f : nat -> nat -> nat.
Fixpoint do_n (n : nat) (k : nat) :=
  match n with
    | 0 => k
    | S n' => do_n n' (f k k)
  end.

Notation big := (_ = _).
Axiom k : nat.
Goal True.
